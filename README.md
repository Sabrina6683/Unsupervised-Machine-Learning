*Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering Songs*

**Task:**

Given a dataset of over 5000 songs with different features the company Moosic wants to cluster these songs into playlists with different moods.
Main questions:
1. Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria?
2. Is K-Means a good method to create playlists?
